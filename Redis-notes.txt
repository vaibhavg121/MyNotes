Redis Notes:-

*In memory data structure store.
*Used as Nosql Database
*Distributed Cache
*Message broker

*Unlike any other nosql databases too.
*Values stored simply as key-value pairs. 

*Redis is kind of like a one huge JSON object which has a lot of key-value pairs inside of it.
*Bcz it runs on RAm, it's super fast & efficient

*It is mostly used on top on any traditional database, like mysql or mongodb, etc.
So, when u have a very long & slow query OR u have data that u need to access all the time & doesn't change often,
U store this data in Redis on top of it already being in ur traditional database behind.

Thus, when in future u need this data, u check inside redis first, and if its already in redis, u get it from there to save computation time and avoid expensive database calls too.

*It's ,primarily used for caching, 
i.e things u use more often or things that need a lot of time to compute.
That way, u get them super quick when u need these values again in future.

data structures supported =>
string, hashes, list, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglog, geospatialindexes

* Starting redis server
=> redis-server (In one ubuntu window)

* Opening redis-cli
=> redis-cli (In another ubuntu window)

*Running redis server as a service in the background 
=> sudo service redis-server start

*Stopping the above service
=> sudo service redis-server stop

*Restarting the service while its ongoing
=> sudo service redis-server restart

================================================================================================

Once we enter redis-cli, we can run all the redis commands

* setting string in key-value format 
==> set name Vaibhav
=> (set key value)

* getting that value
==> get name
-> outputs - "Vaibhav"

* deleting a key name
==> del name
(Now if u "get name" it'll be nil)

* checking if a key exists in the database 
==> exists name
(if exists - it returns (integer)1 else it returns (integer)0)

* getting all the keys present in db
==> keys *
(returns all keys present)

* erasing everything from the database
=> flushall
(if u run "keys *" after "flushall" u'll get nothing)

* clearing the redis-cli
==> clear

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ttl -> "time to live"
* By default if u dont define ttl, it'll be -1, which means no expiration time.

* checking ttl
==> ttl name
(ttl keyName - will return -1 if not specifically defined)

* setting expiration time to a key (Already existing key)
=> expire name 10
(expire key timeInSeconds - Now kay-name will expire in 10 seconds & we can track it using "ttl name")

* setting an expiration time to a key while setting the key for the 1st time
=> setex name 10 vaibhav
(setex keyName expirationInSeconds value)
